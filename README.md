## Overview

Amfa is a virtual art installation and a website that compiles letters people write to their future or great love, to be shared publicly. It also serves as an urban intervention, with the letters being wheat-pasted around the city. The project originated in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, and encourages its spectators (or potential future collaborators) to share their poetic perspectives on the concept of the future/great love. This document will primarily focus on the virtual aspect of the project (the website) as well as its technical details. The AMFA website functions as a virtual posting wall, displaying the letters submitted by visitors in the text area. Additionally, letters can be sent to AMFAâ€™s email address and posted by the admin team.

## Key features
